# eSTK.me Cloud Enhance Server

Due to the end of life (EOL) of the ESTKme series cards (ECO, 400K) and the lack of any indication that the rLPA v2 protocol will be open-sourced, project maintenance has been suspended.

### Introduction

This is a simple server designed to handle requests from the eSTK.me removable eUICC, such as downloads and notifications.

If you donâ€™t have an eUICC yet, you can purchase one from [eSTK.me](https://www.estk.me?aid=esim) and use the coupon code `eSIMCyou` to get 10% off. We recommend [eSTK.me](https://www.estk.me?aid=esim) if you need to perform profile downloads on iOS devices.

If you require more than 1MB of storage to install multiple eSIM profiles, we recommend [9eSIM](https://www.9esim.com/?coupon=DAMON). Use the coupon code `DAMON` to also receive 10% off.

### Installation

You can download the binary release from the [releases page](https://github.com/damonto/estkme-cloud/releases) or you can build it yourself.

If you want to build it yourself, you can run the following commands:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:damonto/estkme-cloud.git
cd estkme-cloud
go build -trimpath -ldflags="-w -s" -o estkme-cloud main.go
```

Sometimes, you might need to set executable permissions for the binary file using the following command:

```bash
chmod +x estkme-cloud
```

You must also install the following dependencies:

```bash
# Debian
apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends ca-certificates libpcsclite1 libcurl4
# Arch Linux
pacman -S pcsclite
```

Once done, you can run the server using the following command:

```bash
./estkme-cloud
```

If you want to change the default port, lpac version or data directory, you can use the following flags:

```plaintext
./estkme-cloud --help

Usage of estkme-cloud:
  -advertising string
        advertising message to show on the server (max: 100 characters)
  -dir string
        the directory to store lpac (default "/tmp/estkme-cloud")
  -dont-download
        don't download lpac
  -listen-address string
        eSTK.me cloud enhance server listen address (default ":1888")
  -version string
        the version of lpac to download (default "v2.0.1")
  -verbose
        verbose mode
```

If you wish to run the program in the background, you can utilize the systemctl command. Here is an example of how to achieve this:

1. Start by creating a service file in the /etc/systemd/system directory. For instance, you can name the file estkme-cloud.service and include the following content:

```plaintext
[Unit]
Description=eSTK.me Cloud Enhance Server
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=your_user_here
Restart=on-failure
ExecStart=/your/binary/path/here/estkme-cloud
RestartSec=10s
TimeoutStopSec=30s

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

2. Then, use the following command to start the service:

```bash
systemctl start estkme-cloud
```

3. If you want the service to start automatically upon system boot, use the following command:

```bash
systemctl enable estkme-cloud
```

#### Docker

You can also run the server using Docker. You can use the following command to run the server:

```bash
docker run -d --name estkme-cloud -p 1888:1888 damonto/estkme-cloud:latest
# or use the GitHub Container Registry
docker run -d --name estkme-cloud -p 1888:1888 ghcr.io/damonto/estkme-cloud:latest
```

### How To Use

Once the server is running, the server will listen on the specified port (default: 1888) and you can send requests to the server.

#### Download

To download a profile, you should enable the `Cloud Enhance` feature on the eUICC and set the server listening address to the server address. The server will handle the download request and download the profile to the eUICC.

The server support downloading profiles with confirmation code and custom IMEI.

If your eSIM provider requires a confirmation code, you can use the following activation code format:

```plaintext
LPA:1$SM-DP+$Matching Id$$<confirmation_code>
```

Please replace `<confirmation_code>` with the actual confirmation code.

If your eSIM provider requires a custom IMEI, you can use the following activation code format:

1. With confirmation code:

```plaintext
LPA:1$SM-DP+$Matching Id$$<confirmation_code>#<custom_imei>
```

2. Without confirmation code:

```plaintext
LPA:1$SM-DP+$Matching Id#<custom_imei>
```

Please replace `<custom_imei>` with the actual IMEI.

#### Useful Commands

##### Consume Data

You can also use the following command to consume your cellular data:

```plaintext
/data <amount_of_data_in_KiB>
```

Please replace `<amount_of_data_in_KiB>` with the actual data amount.

##### List Notifications

You can use the following command to list the last 4 notifications:

```plaintext
/ln <enable|disable|install|delete>
```

##### Process Notification

You can use the following command to process notification:

```plaintext
/process <seq number>
```

You can get the `seq number` from the `/ln` command.

#### Notification

If you click the "Process Notification" button on the eSTK.me eUICC, the server will receive a notification request and send all notifications.
